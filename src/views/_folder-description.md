# views

## Folder Description

This folder is named "views" more out of convention than actual usage, as the application doesn't use a router and has only one page. Nonetheless, this folder contains files that can be considered as application pages.

## Folder Content

### Files

- `rubik-cube-app-view.vue`: Contains a Vue component that encapsulates all the application logic. It serves as the main page component, and everything you see when using the app is rendered here.
